# Mailing list

Every user that signs up gets added to a mailing list table with a specific unsubscribe ID you can then use tu unsubscribe them. 
This logic is build around the "Notify me when the app is ready" feature, that enables you to build a list of people that are interested in your application before you even launch. 

You can export your complete mailing list to csv from the admin/mailinglist page.
